### Hello! My name is Aaron ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy being creative with either artwork or with web designs.  I am currently learning how to utilize a Wacom pen tablet to design artwork and logos for websites.  I love to learn new coding languages and am excited for the journey that front end and back end development are taking me on!
